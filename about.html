    <h1>About Newfound Living</h1>
    <section class="about-section">
      <p>
        Newfound Living is a proudly Newfoundland-owned rental company built on trust, hard work, and genuine care for both tenants and properties.<br>
        Founded by Ryan Parsons, a local homeowner with a passion for real estate, Newfound Living began with one simple goal — to provide clean, comfortable, and reliable homes that people are proud to live in.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re not a property management company. We own every property we rent. That means tenants deal directly with the owner — no middlemen, no confusion, no delays. When you rent with Newfound Living, you’re renting from someone who truly cares about the home and the people living in it.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        What started as a single home renovation project grew into a passion for building long-term value through real estate. Over the years, Newfound Living has expanded to include multiple rental homes across St. John’s, Mount Pearl, and surrounding areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each home has been thoughtfully updated — from flooring and modern kitchens to new bathrooms and energy-efficient upgrades — to create a space that feels warm, safe, and truly move-in ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Our approach is simple:</strong><br>
        Take care of the homes, take care of the people, and the rest takes care of itself.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To provide tenants with modern, affordable, and well-maintained homes while reinvesting in the community through responsible ownership and continual improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that renting should be a positive experience — one built on respect, communication, and fairness. Every decision we make, from renovations to lease terms, reflects that belief.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Values</h2>

        <li>💡 <strong>Growth:</strong> As we continue to expand, our focus remains on quality over quantity — ensuring every tenant feels valued and every home is properly maintained.</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>
      <h2>Why Choose Newfound Living</h2>
      <p>
        Because we treat our tenants like neighbors, not numbers.<br>
        When you rent from Newfound Living, you get the peace of mind that comes from knowing your landlord is invested in your comfort and experience, not just collecting rent.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe great rentals start with great relationships — built on respect, reliability, and Newfoundland hospitality.
