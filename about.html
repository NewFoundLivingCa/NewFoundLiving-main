    <h1>About Newfound Living</h1>
    <section class="about-section">
      <p>
        Newfound Living is a Newfoundland-owned rental company built on trust, hard work, and genuine care for both tenants and the homes we offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Founded by Ryan Parsons, a local homeowner with a long-time interest in real estate, Newfound Living started with a simple goal — to provide clean, comfortable, and dependable homes that people are proud to live in.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re not a property management company. We own every property we rent. That means tenants deal directly with the owner — no middlemen, no confusion, and no delays. When you rent with Newfound Living, you’re renting from someone who cares about the home and the people living in it.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        What began as a small renovation project grew into a genuine passion for real estate and building long-term value through responsible ownership. Over time, Newfound Living has expanded to include several rental homes across St. John’s, Mount Pearl, and nearby communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each home has been carefully updated — from new flooring and modern kitchens to renovated bathrooms and energy-efficient improvements — all with the goal of creating spaces that feel safe, comfortable, and ready to call home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our approach is simple: take care of the homes, take care of the people, and everything else tends to fall into place.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to provide tenants with modern, affordable, and well-maintained homes while reinvesting in our community through thoughtful improvements and local ownership.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe renting should be straightforward and positive — built on respect, communication, and fairness. Every decision we make, from upgrades to lease terms, reflects that belief.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Values</h2>

        <li><strong>Community:</strong> We live here, we invest here, and we care about keeping neighborhoods strong.</li>
        <li><strong>Growth:</strong> As we expand, our focus stays on quality over quantity — making sure every tenant feels valued.</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>

      <h2>Why Choose Newfound Living</h2>
      <p>
        Because we treat tenants like neighbors, not numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you rent from Newfound Living, you can count on a landlord who takes pride in the homes and genuinely wants you to enjoy living there. We believe great rentals come from great relationships — built on respect, reliability, and good Newfoundland hospitality.
